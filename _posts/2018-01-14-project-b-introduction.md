Project B will be an opportunity for me to explore Unity 5 and to learn how to develop 2D games. In this project, I will build a small platform game based on an [excellent course](https://www.lynda.com/Games-tutorials/Unity-5-2D-Essential-Training/494386-2.html) created by Jesse Freeman.

During this project I will learn how to:

* Import existing artwork to Unity
* Configure sprites
* Implement repeating background textures
* Create an animated character
* Spawn obstacles on the game scene
* Build basic UI in Unity
* Code C# scripts to develop the game logic

#### Motivation

Learn how to develop video games is an old dream of mine. However, I have always been busy with something else, especially work, studies, family or playing video games. Directed Studies class is an amazing opportunity for me to finally learn the basics of game development since I will have a compromise to deliver something at the end of the term. This will definitely make me more motivated to keep studying.

The game that I will build in Project B is scalable, according to Jesse Freeman. It means that, after finishing this course, I will be able to change the artwork, develop more advanced mechanics, improve features, and come up with a new, unique game.

#### Deliverables

On this blog, I will post weekly updates about the progress of my work and the source code will be available on Github.

Moreover, I will present this game to the class on March 8th.
