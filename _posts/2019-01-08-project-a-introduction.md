The topic I have chosen for Project A is React Native. In this project, I will build a small mobile app that is a YouTube Replica, based on an [amazing tutorial](https://medium.com/react-native-training/react-native-youtube-replica-f378200d91f0) created by Marlon Decosta.

In more detail, the topics covered in this tutorial are:

* React Native
* React Navigation
* Android emulator
* YouTube API

#### Motivation

I have chosen this topic because I really want to learn how to build hybrid mobile applications. Another reason is that React Native is quite in demand, since I have seen many job posts requiring candidates who have this skill.

#### Resources

In order to learn React Native, I will follow an amazing tutorial on how to build a YouTube Replica app.
