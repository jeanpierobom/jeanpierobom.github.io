I have completed 2 more chapters in the course during this week:

* Chapter 4 - Object Pooling
* Chapter 5 - Creating the Player

At this point, the player character was included in the game. This players responds to user interaction by jumping. As mentioned before, the objective is for the player to avoid all obstacles:

This course is amazing because it teaches smart techniques that can be used for making the game to be more efficient. One example is the object pooling mechanism: basically, instead of creating obstacles and destroying them several times, a component was created to reuse these obstacle objects. It helps to avoid using excessive memory from the user smartphone.

#### Next Steps

I have plans to complete the remaining chapters in the course by the next week:

* Chapter 6 - Setting Up the Game
* Chapter 7 - Polishing the Game
* Chapter 8 - Creating More Obstacles
* Chapter 9 - Publishing
