The topic I have chosen for Project A is React Native. In this project, I will build a small mobile app that is a YouTube Replica, based on an [amazing tutorial](https://medium.com/react-native-training/react-native-youtube-replica-f378200d91f0) created by Marlon Decosta.

In more detail, the topics covered in this tutorial are:

* React Native
* React Navigation
* Android emulator
* YouTube API

#### Motivation

I have chosen this topic because I want to learn how to build hybrid mobile applications. Another reason is that React Native is quite in demand since I have seen many job posts requiring candidates who have this skill.

Additionally, learning how to use the YouTube API will definitely be useful for me in Project 2 class. 

#### Prototype Features

This prototype is a small replica of YouTube and includes the following features: 

* Videos list: it retrieves a list of latest videos from a YouTube channel that is configured hard coded. Since this is a limited replica, the user can't change the channel or search for more videos.
* Video player: the user can watch a video by clicking on a thumbnail in the videos list.

#### Deliverables

There will be weekly updates about the progress of my work on this blog. Moreover, the source code will be available on Github.

In addition to this prototype, I am also going to write a tutorial to help beginners like me to start getting their hands dirty with React Native.
