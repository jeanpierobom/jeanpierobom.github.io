In the past few days I have completed the remaining chapters in the Unity 5 2D Essential Training:

* Chapter 6 - Setting Up the Game
* Chapter 7 - Polishing the Game
* Chapter 8 - Creating More Obstacles
* Chapter 9 - Publishing

These chapters tought me how to code the game flow, including how to start the game, the game over conditions and also how to restart the game. Next, a score system was added by using UI components and the game manager that stores (locally) the best score of the player. Also, an illumination effect was applied to beautify the game stage. Additionaly, more obstacles were added, including an animated TV and the running zombie.


At this point, the course is completed and I have a functional version of the game.

#### Do You Want to Play?

You can play the Super Zombie Runner [here](https://jeanpierobom.github.io/super-zombie-runner/). Unity games requires the WebGL plugin on browsers, so you might be asked to confirm the installation of this plugin before playing the game.

#### Next Steps

The instructor of the course mentioned that this game could be improved by students, in order to make it unique. in the next few days, I will try to create new artwork for the game, and maybe modify the gameplay a little bit. I also want to export and test the game in a mobile device.
