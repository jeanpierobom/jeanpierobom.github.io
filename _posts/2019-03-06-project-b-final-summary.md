As I mentioned before in this blog, I always wanted to learn how to develop video games since I have a passion for this topic. Directed Studies class gave me an amazing opportunity to explore this with the compromise of delivering something at the end of the course.

After finishing this project, I feel happy that I achieved all goals stablished at the beginning of the term. I still feel that there are some skill gaps that I need to feel in order to be prepared to create more amazing games (dealing with graphics, for example), but it was an amazing start.

Now I have plans to keep studying Unity and creating small games as a hobby.

#### Link to the Game

You can play the game on (https://jeanpierobom.github.io/game/)[https://jeanpierobom.github.io/game/]. WebGL plugin is required.

#### Building the Game

The final version of the game is available on a GitHub repository: (https://github.com/jeanpierobom/super-zombie-runner)[https://github.com/jeanpierobom/super-zombie-runner]. If you want to open it in Unity, just follow these steps:

- Download and install Unity on your computer. The installer can be downloaded from (https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)[https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download]
- Download the project from GitHub and unzip the project file: (https://github.com/jeanpierobom/super-zombie-runner)[https://github.com/jeanpierobom/super-zombie-runner]
- Open the project file in Unity
- Play the game by pressing the play button on the Unity menu
- If you want to build the game for a specific platform (PC or HTML 5, for example), you can do this on File / Build Settings...

#### Presentation

This is the [presentation file](https://github.com/jeanpierobom/jeanpierobom.github.io/blob/master/assets/presentation.pdf) for Directed Studies class.
