In Project A, I will study React Native.

#### Motivation

I have chosen this topic because I really want to learn how to build hybrid mobile applications. Another reason is that React Native is quite in demand, since I have seen many job posts requiring candidates who have this skill.

#### Resources

In order to learn React Native, I will follow an amazing tutorial on how to build a YouTube Replica app.
