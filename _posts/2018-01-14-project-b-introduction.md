Project B will be an opportunity for me to explore Unity 5 and to learn how to developed 2D games. In this project, I will build a small platform game based on an [excellent course](https://www.lynda.com/Games-tutorials/Unity-5-2D-Essential-Training/494386-2.html) created by Jesse Freeman.

During this project I will learn:

* Import existing artwork to Unity
* Configure sprites
* Implement repeating background textures
* Create an animated character
* Spawn obstacles on the game scene
* Build basic UI in Unity
* Code scripts im C# to develop the game logic

#### Motivation

I have an old dream to learn how to develop video games. However, I have always been busy with something else, especially work, studies,  family or playing video games. Directed Studies is an amazing opportunity for me to finally learn the basics of game dev, since I will have a compromisse to deliver something at the end of the term.

The game that I will build in Project B is scalable, according to Jesse Freeman. It means that, after finishing this course, I will be able to change the artwork, develop more advanced mechanics, improve features, and come up with a new game, unique game.
