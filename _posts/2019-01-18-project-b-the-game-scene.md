In the last few days, I have completed the following chapters in the course:

* Chapter 1 - Working with Sprites
* Chapter 2 - Creating Repeating Textures
* Chapter 3 - Creating Obstacles

At this time, the textures for the scenario are set and they move with parallax scrolling. It means that the background texture moves slower than the foreground texture. It creates an interesting sensation of depth in the game. Also, there is a spawner object in the game, that creates random obstacles for the player to jump.

The sprite for the player was not included yet though.

#### Next Steps

I expect to complete the following chapters by the next week:

* Chapter 4 - Object Pooling
* Chapter 5 - Creating the Player

#### Github

There is a Github repository where the game code is stored: https://github.com/jeanpierobom/super-zombie-runner
