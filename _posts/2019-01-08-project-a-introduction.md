The topic I have chosen for Project A is React Native. In this project, I will build a small mobile app that is a YouTube Replica, based on an [amazing tutorial](https://medium.com/react-native-training/react-native-youtube-replica-f378200d91f0) created by Marlon Decosta.

In more detail, the topics covered in this tutorial are:

* React Native
* React Navigation
* Android emulator
* YouTube API

#### Motivation

I have chosen this topic because I want to learn how to build hybrid mobile applications. Another reason is that React Native is quite in demand since I have seen many job posts requiring candidates who have this skill.

Additionally, learning how to use the YouTube API will definitely be useful for me in Project 2 class. 

#### Prototype Features

The result of this project is expected to be a minimal version of the YouTube app. Instead of allowing the user to navigate and search for an immense range of videos, it will retrieve videos from a single YouTube channel and display them in the initial screen. The user can't change the channel, since it is configured hard coded. Given this list of videos, the user can click on the thumbnail of the video and a new screen with a YouTube player will be opened.

#### Deliverables

There will be weekly updates about the progress of my work on this blog. Moreover, the source code will be available on Github.

In addition to this prototype, I am also going to write a tutorial to help beginners like me to start getting their hands dirty with React Native.
