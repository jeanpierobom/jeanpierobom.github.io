THIS IS YET A DRAFT (work in progress)

In Project A, I developed a small app based on a [tutorial](https://medium.com/react-native-training/react-native-youtube-replica-f378200d91f0) created by Marlon Decosta. This app is a YouTube replica and was developed using React Native.

Inspired on this project, I am now providing another tutorial to create a similar app with same technology. This time, we are going to develop an app that will communicate with Vimeo, another popular platform for video sharing.

#### Create a Vimeo Account and Register an APP

The first step in this tutorial is to create an account on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/). The free subscription is fine for this project. 
After creating an account, the next step is to register an app on [Vimeo Developer page](https://developer.vimeo.com/apps).

After registering the app, we are able to generate an access token that will be used when communicating with the API.
