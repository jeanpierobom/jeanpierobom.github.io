Working with React Native and dealing with third party API's was extremely useful for me this term. I feel that studying React Native fills a gap in the WMDD program since I was expecting to study this relevant topic from the beginning of the program. Also, all these integrations with APIâ€™s will be used in the web app that I am developing for Project 2 class.

Overall, I am very satisfied with my progress in this project and also that I achieved the goals I set at the beginning of the term.

Fortunately, there were no unexpected challenges. I believe that the reason for such a smooth journey is because the material I have chosen to study is well organized and detailed.

I hope that the knowledge I acquired in Directed Studies class will be super important to my professional career as a web / mobile developer.
