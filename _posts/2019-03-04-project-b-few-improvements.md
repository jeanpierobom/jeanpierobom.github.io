title:  "Developing a Few Improvements"

After completing the game by following the course, I wanted to make some improvements to it on my own. First, I was planning to create different artwork for the game, but after some time trying to draw and animate a new hero, I changed my mind. This is a new hero that I drew in Illustrator:

<img src="https://jeanpierobom.github.io/assets/images/dog-spritesheet.png" alt="Dog Sprite Sheet">

In my opinion, the dog drawing is not bad. However, the animation does not have smooth transitions between each frame. Another problem is that, when I imported the sprite sheet to Unity, it looked blurry. I consider studying more in the future on how to import and configure sprites in Unity.

So, instead of working in artwork, I made a small improvement to the gameplay by adding a "double jump" feature. In the original version of the game, it was difficult to jump over an obstacle depending on where you landed from a previous jump. So I feel that adding the double jump could be a good way to solve. However, now I feel that the game is too easy...

Next, I added some sound effects to the game. Navigating on the Unity Asset Store, I found two free, great SFX packs. So I selected sounds effects from these packs and added them to the following objects/events:

- Player jump
- Game Over
- Best Score
- TV static
- Zombies

With these small improvements, I consider that my work is finished for Directed Studies class Project 2.
