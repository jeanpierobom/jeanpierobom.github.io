In this post I am going to provide more details about the components created or used in this prototype:

- The main code component in this project is the App.js file. It defines the layout for the initial screen as well as is responsible for connecting with the YouTube API to retrieve a list of videos from a YouTube channel.

- Another important component in this project is the YouTubeVideo.js file, that is responsible for the screen that is shown when the user clicks on a thumbnail. This screen displays a YouTube video player from a module called react-native-youtube.

- This project also includes a module called react-native-vector-icons, that provides a set of icons that are used to create a navigation bar, very similar to YouTube original app.

- Finally, a package called react-navigation is being used to implement navigation between screens.

At this time, the prototype is completed and below there are some screenshots from the app:
