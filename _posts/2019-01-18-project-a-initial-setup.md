During this week I have been working to setup the basic structure of the project. I was able to complete the steps listed below:

* Installation of Android Studio and React Native
* Generated the project folder by using the react-native command line tool
* Installed a few packages that are required in this project
* Get an authentication key to use YouTube API
* Setup a Github repository

At this point, it is possible to run the app on the Android Emulator and the default screen for React Native projects is displayed:

#### Next Steps

Because this tutorial is not very long, I expect to finish it by the next week.

#### Github

There is a Github repository where the app code is stored: [https://github.com/jeanpierobom/youtube-replica](https://github.com/jeanpierobom/youtube-replica)
