In the past few days I have completed the remaining chapters in the Unity 5 2D Essential Training:

* Chapter 6 - Setting Up the Game
* Chapter 7 - Polishing the Game
* Chapter 8 - Creating More Obstacles
* Chapter 9 - Publishing

These chapters taught me how to code the game flow, including how to start the game, the game over conditions and also how to restart the game. Next, a scoring system was added by using UI components and the game manager that stores (locally) the best score of the player. Also, an illumination effect was applied to beautify the game stage. Additionally, more obstacles were added, including an animated TV and the running zombie.


At this point, the course is completed and I have a functional version of the game.

#### Do You Want to Play?

You can play the Super Zombie Runner [here](https://jeanpierobom.github.io/super-zombie-runner/). Unity games require the WebGL plugin on browsers, so you might be asked to confirm the installation of this plugin before playing the game.

#### Next Steps

The instructor of the course mentioned that this game could be improved by students, in order to make it unique. I will try to create new artwork for the game before the presentation. I will also try to modify the gameplay a little bit. Finally, I will export the game to mobile devices.
