THIS IS YET A DRAFT (work in progress)

The topic I have chosen for Project A is React Native. In this project, I will build a small mobile app that is a YouTube Replica, based on an [amazing tutorial](https://medium.com/react-native-training/react-native-youtube-replica-f378200d91f0) created by Marlon Decosta.
